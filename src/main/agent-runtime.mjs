//
// There is no privileged headless "brain" anymore: an agent is just a tmux terminal (owned by
// terminal-manager.mjs) whose command runs a pluggable backend pointed at the agent-socket relay. The
// backend survives BlitzOS restarts through tmux supervision and /says clean replies into its chat widget
// over the unchanged agent-socket contract. This module owns the only agent-specific bits:
//   • the bootstrap prompt (the served blitzos-agents.md is the source of truth; this is a thin pointer),
//   • backend-specific command strings (Claude TUI vs Codex serverless), and
//   • backend metadata such as Claude's persisted --session-id token.
// Both transports (Electron + server) import THIS one file — no per-transport fork.
